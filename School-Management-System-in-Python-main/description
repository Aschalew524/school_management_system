In our project, we will only use it to manage some basic personal information of the students of a school.

The objective of this is to create a GUI based School Management System. To build this, you will need intermediate understanding of Tkinter library and SQLite API and basic understanding of TkCalender, Datetime libraries, messagebox and Ttk modules.

To build this project, we will need the following libraries:

1. Tkinter – To create the GUI.
2. SQLite3 – To connect the program to the database and store information in it.
3. TkCalender – To get the user to enter a date.
4. Datetime.date – To convert the date from the tree to a Datetime.date instance so that it can be set in.
5. Tkinter.messagebox – To show a display box, displaying some information or an error.
6. Tkinter.ttk – To create the tree where all the information will be displayed.
